  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: January 18, 2026</p>

  <p>By using tunn ("the Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use the Service.</p>

  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>tunn lets you expose local services to the internet via reverse tunnels. We aim to provide reliable service but don't guarantee uptime or availability.</p>

  <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
  <p>You need a verified email address to use tunn (via GitHub login or magic link). You must be at least 13 years old. You're responsible for your account security and everything that happens under it.</p>

  <h2>3. Don't Be Evil</h2>
  <p>Don't use tunn for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anything illegal</li>
    <li>Malware, phishing, spam, or fraud</li>
    <li>Harassing or harming others</li>
    <li>Attacking other systems</li>
    <li>Circumventing our rate limits</li>
    <li>Anything that makes us look bad or causes us problems</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This list isn't exhaustive. Use common sense.</p>

  <h2>4. Termination</h2>
  <p><strong>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.</strong> This includes but is not limited to: violations of these terms, abuse reports, suspicious activity, or at our discretion. We are not required to provide a reason.</p>
  <p>If you're banned, you may not create new accounts to circumvent the ban.</p>

  <h2>5. Rate Limits</h2>
  <p>Free accounts get 100 MB/month. Pro accounts get more. We may adjust these limits. Attempting to circumvent limits is grounds for termination.</p>

  <h2>6. Billing and Refunds</h2>
  <p>Pro subscriptions are billed monthly or yearly in advance. Subscriptions auto-renew until cancelled. You may cancel at any time; cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.</p>
  <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> We'll refund up to one billing period (one month for monthly, one year for yearly) if requested within 30 days of the charge. After 30 days, no refunds. We don't prorate partial months. If you've used the service extensively and request a refund, we may decline at our discretion.</p>
  <p>We use Stripe for payment processing. By subscribing, you also agree to <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/consumer">Stripe's terms</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Content</h2>
  <p>You're solely responsible for everything transmitted through your tunnels. We don't monitor traffic, but we may act on abuse reports without investigation.</p>

  <h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless tunn and its operators from any claims, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Service or violation of these terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve any disputes with us individually. You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against us.</p>
  <p><strong>Governing Law:</strong> These terms are governed by Connecticut law. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Connecticut.</p>

  <h2>12. General</h2>
  <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>
  <p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and tunn regarding the Service.</p>
  <p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision doesn't waive our right to enforce it later.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance. You can stop using the Service if you disagree with any changes.</p>
